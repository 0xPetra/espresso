Set Merkle Tree
===============

The Set Merkle Tree is an authenticated data structure representing a set
of `Nullifier`s, primarily supporting:
 - Insertion
 - Proofs of inclusion/exclusion

Cryptographic primitives
------------------------

The Set Merkle Tree uses 3 hash functions
 - `H_elem   : Nullifier       -> Digest`
 - `H_leaf   : Nullifier       -> Digest`
 - `H_branch : (Digest,Digest) -> Digest`

Here, `Digest` is a bit-array type of some fixed length `N`, and we assume:
 - There is some special value `EMPTY_HASH: Digest`, such that finding a
   preimage of `EMPTY_HASH` for any `H` in `{H_elem,H_leaf,H_branch}` is
   infeasible.
 - It is infeasible to find any values `(H1,x)`, `(H2,y)` such that
   `(H1,x) != (H2,y)`, `H1,H2 \in {H_elem,H_leaf,H_branch}`, and
   `H1(x) == H2(y)`.
    - This implies that `H_elem`, `H_leaf`, and `H_branch` are
      collision-resistant
    - This also implies that finding any overlap in the images of the hashes
      is infeasible, eg, finding any values `x` and `y` such that
      `H_branch(y) == H_elem(x)`.

In the implementation:
 - N == 512, since `Blake2B` has a 64-byte output
 - `EMPTY_HASH` is the all-zero string.
 - `H_elem(nul)`   is `h(canonical_serialize(nul))` where `h` is `Blake2B`
   personalized with "AAPSet Elem"
 - `H_leaf(nul)`   is `h(canonical_serialize(nul))` where `h` is `Blake2B`
   personalized with "AAPSet Leaf"
 - `H_branch(nul)` is `h("l"||l||"r"||r)` where `h` is `Blake2B`
   personalized with "AAPSet Branch"

We also assume that any sparse array `arr` of size `2^N` has less than
`negl(N)` non-empty elements.

Ideal Trees
-----------

Given a set of nullifiers `arr_S = {nul_1,...,nul_k}`, we define the set
merkle tree by first converting it into a sparse array `arr_S` of size
`2^N`, such that:
 - for each `i \in {1,...,k}`,
   `arr_S[LittleEndian(H_elem(nul_i))] == nul_i`
 - for all other indices `ix`, `arr_S[ix] == <EMPTY>`

where LittleEndian converts a little-endian bitstring into a natural
number, ie:
    LittleEndian([]) = 0
    LittleEndian(arr) = arr[0] + 2*LittleEndian(arr[1..])

Now we can define the "ideal tree" `IT` of an array inductively:
 - IT([<EMPTY>]) = ITEmptyLeaf
 - IT([elem]) = ITLeaf(elem)
 - IT(arr) = ITBranch(
    IT(arr[0..(length(arr)/2)]),
    IT(arr[(length(arr/2))..length(arr)]))

Note that IT is injective.

The hash of the Set Merkle Tree is then defined on `IT(arr_S)`:
 - hash(ITEmptyLeaf) = EMPTY_HASH
 - hash(ITLeaf(elem)) = H_leaf(elem)
 - if hash(l) == EMPTY_HASH and hash(r) == EMPTY_HASH,
    then hash(ITBranch(l,r)) = EMPTY_HASH
    else hash(ITBranch(l,r)) = H_branch(hash(l),hash(r))

The actual implementation includes several modifications to make the
computational and memory cost lower than directly working with `IT`, but
in a correct implementation all operations will match the result on `IT`.

Inserting into an ideal tree is done by:

    IT_insert(t: IT, nul: Nullifier) -> IT:
        let b_0,...,b_{N-1} = H_elem(nul);
        return IT_insert_inner(t,nul,[b_{N-1},b_{N-2},...,b_0])

    IT_insert_inner(t: IT, nul: Nullifier, path: [bit]) -> IT:
        match t {
            ITEmptyLeaf => {
                assert(path == []);
                return ITLeaf(nul);
            }
            ITLeaf(elem) => {
                assert(path == []);
                assert(elem == nul);
                return ITLeaf(elem);
            }
            ITBranch(l,r) => {
                if path[0] == 1 {
                    return ITBranch(l,IT_insert_inner(r,nul,path[1..]));
                } else {
                    return ITBranch(IT_insert_inner(l,nul,path[1..]),r);
                }
            }
        }

Lemma:
    for any arr,nul,path, such that 2^length(path) == length(arr),

           IT_insert_inner(IT(arr),nul,path)
        == IT(arr[LittleEndian(path) := nul])

    where `arr[ix := y]` is the array `arr2` such that if `i != ix`,
    `arr2[i] == arr[i]`, and `arr2[ix] == y`.

Proof: by induction.

Theorem:
    For any arr,nul such that 2^N == length(arr),

       IT_insert(IT(arr),nul)
    == IT(arr[LittleEndian(H_elem(nul)) := nul])

Proof: Apply the lemma.

A proof of inclusion for `elem` in `S` is a sequence of `Digest`s
`sib_0,...,sib_{N-1}` of "sibling subtrees", ie:
    sib(i,elem) -> Digest:
        let b_0,...,b_{N-1} = H_elem(elem);
        let sib_lower = LittleEndian([0,0,...0,,(1-b_i),b_{i+1},...,b_{N-1}]);
        let sib_upper = LittleEndian([1,1,...1,,(1-b_i),b_{i+1},...,b_{N-1}]);

        return hash(IT(arr_S[sib_lower..(sib_upper+1)]));

Conceptually, if we walk down the ideal tree to where `elem` would get
inserted, we will hit many `ITBranch(l,r)` nodes. If we write down the hashes
of the oubtrees we don't go into (ie, if insertion goes into r, write down
`hash(l)`, and vice versa), this will be `sib_{N-1},...,sib_0`.

A proof of exclusion for `elem` is similar, except it is
`sib_i,...,sib_{N-1}` for some `i` such that following the path
`b_{N-1},...,b_i` brings us to an empty subtree.

Checking each type of proof amounts to calculating `hash(IT(arr_S))` using
these sibling hashes, and checking that it matches.

Theorem: inclusion and exclusion proofs are complete.
Proof: Follows from the definition of `hash(IT(arr_S))`.

Theorem:
    Given an honestly constructed root hash `H = hash(IT(arr_S))`,
    inclusion and exclusion proofs are computationally sound.
Proof:
    Suppose we have an adversary that can generate a false inclusion or
    exclusion proof for `elem`. Let `b_0,...,b_{N-1} = H_elem(elem)`.

    This means there are two sequences
        g_i,g_{i+1},...,g_N
        h_j,h_{j+1},...,h_N
    such that:
     - for all k in {i,...,N-1},
        if b_k == 0, g_{k+1} == hash(ITBranch(g_k,sib_k))
        if b_k == 1, g_{k+1} == hash(ITBranch(sib_k,g_k))
     - for all k in {j,...,N-1},,
        if b_k == 0, h_{k+1} == hash(ITBranch(h_k,sib_k))
        if b_k == 1, h_{k+1} == hash(ITBranch(sib_k,h_k))
     - g_N == h_N == H
     - if `elem` is in `S`, `i == 0`, `g_i = H_leaf(elem)`, and
       `h_j == EMPTY_HASH`
     - if `elem` is not in `S`, `j == 0`, `g_j = H_leaf(elem)`, and
       `g_i == EMPTY_HASH`

    From these two sequences, we can walk "down the tree" from `N` to `0`,
    and find one of the following:
     (a) some `k` such that `g_{k+1} == h_{k+1}` but `g_k != h_k`, which
         yields a collision of `H_branch`.
     (b) `j > 0` and `g_j == h_j == EMPTY_HASH`
         or `i > 0`, and `g_i == h_i == EMPTY_HASH`
         which yield a preimage of `EMPTY_HASH` for `H_branch`.
     (c) `g_0 == h_0`, which yields a preimage of `EMPTY_HASH` for
         `H_leaf`
    each of which violates our cryptographic assumptions.

Corollary: For any t1: IT(arr_S1), t2: IT(arr_S2),
    if hash(t1) == hash(t2), then under our computational assumptions,
    arr_S1 == arr_S2.

Proof:
    Let `n1` be the number of non-empty slots in `arr_S1` and `n2` the
    same for `arr_S2`. By assumption, `n1 < negl(N)` and
    `n2 < negl(N)`. If there is any slot which differs between
    `arr_S1` and `arr_S2`, we can calculate a proof of inclusion
    relative to the other, violating computational soundness.

NOTE: because we're assuming that collisions are infeasible, N needs to be
large enough that |S| is much less than 2^(N/2), since at ~2^(N/2) you will
start encountering birthday-bound collisions.

Practical Trees
---------------

The ideal tree decription can be optimized to have a smaller memory
footprint and smaller proofs. Let's call this the "Practical Tree" (PT).
For the same array, there may be multiple valid PTs, so we will define PTs
by an inductive predicate instead of as a function:
    PTEmptySubtree is PT(height,arr) if:
        arr == [<EMPTY>,<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY>], and
        length(arr) == 2^height
    PTLeaf(height,elem) is PT(height,arr) if:
        arr == [<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY>,elem,<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY>] (ie, arr only
            contains `elem`), and
        length(arr) == 2^height
    PTBranch(l,r) is PT(height,arr) if:
        length(arr) == 2^height, and
        l is not PTEmptySubtree and
        r is not PTEmptySubtree and
        l is PT(height-1,arr[0..(length(arr)/2)]), and
        r is PT(height-1,arr[(length(arr)/2)..length(arr)]))

For simplicity, PT forbids branch nodes from having two empty children.

If `arr` is well-formed (ie, there is some set S such that arr == arr_S), a
PT can be "idealized" by:
    PT_idealize(height, t: PT(height,arr)) -> IT:
        if t is PTEmptySubtree:
            if height == 0:
                return ITEmptyLeaf
            else:
                return ITBranch(PT_idealize(height-1, PTEmptySubtree),
                                PT_idealize(height-1, PTEmptySubtree))
        else if t is PTLeaf(height,elem):
            if height == 0:
                return ITLeaf(elem);
            else:
                let B = [b_0,...,b_{N-1}] = H_elem(elem);
                if B[height-1] == 1:
                    return PT_idealize(height,
                                       PTBranch(PTEmptySubtree,
                                                PTLeaf(height-1,elem)))
                else:
                    return PT_idealize(height,
                                       PTBranch(PTLeaf(height-1,elem),
                                                PTEmptySubtree))
        else t is PTBranch(l,r):
            return ITBranch(PT_idealize(height-1,l),PT_idealize(height-1,r));

Theorem:
    if S is a nullifier set, arr_S is its array representation,
        length(arr_S) == 2^height, and pt is PT(height,arr_S),
    then PT_idealize(height, pt) == IT(arr_S)

Proof:
    Induction over pt. The tricky case is PTLeaf(height,elem) with
    height > 0. In this case, pt is representing an array
    a_pt = [<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY>,elem,<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY]. a_pt is a
    subarray of arr_S, whose bounds are determined by the most significant
    bits of H_elem(elem). Thus, the index of elem in a_pt is
    a_pt_ix = LittleEndian(H_elem(elem)[..height]), ie, the number
    represented by the `height` least significant bits of H_elem(elem). So
    when we convert PTLeaf(height,elem) into a branch, we need to figure
    out which side of the array elem is on, so we read the most significant
    of the lowest `height` bits of H_elem, which tells us if a_pt_ix is in
    {0,...,(2^(height-1) - 1)} or {2^(height-1),...,(2^height - 1)}, and
    then we put PTLeaf(height-1,elem) on the appropriate side of a branch
    and continue idealizing.

Hashing the tree is done by copying the ideal tree pattern:
 - hash(PTEmptySubtree) = EMPTY_HASH
 - if H_elem(elem)[height-1] == 1,
        then hash(PTLeaf(height,elem))
            = H_branch(EMPTY_HASH,hash(PTLeaf(height-1,elem)))
        else hash(PTLeaf(height,elem))
            = H_branch(hash(PTLeaf(height-1,elem)),EMPTY_HASH)
 - hash(PTBranch(l,r)) = H_branch(hash(l),hash(r))

By induction, if `pt: PT(height,arr_S)`, then
hash(pt) == hash(PT_idealize(pt)).

Proofs of inclusion/exclusion now can either be a path to an empty subtree,
or a path to a singleton subtree. If the singleton subtree is
PTLeaf(height,leaf_elem) and leaf_elem == elem, it is a proof of inclusion.
Otherwise, it's a proof of exclusion. Since PT hashing matches ideal tree
hashing, these proofs are also complete and computationally sound.


Sparse Representation
---------------------

One last useful construction is included in our implementation: a sparse
in-memory representation of PTs.

If there is some PT `pt`, and you just want to be able to check proofs of
inclusion/exclusion, you only need to keep hash(pt) around. Since the proof
system is computationally sound, you know that any proof that succeeds is
respresentative of the underlying set. However, one can think of an
inclusion/exclusion proof not just as a proof that a particular element is
included/excluded, but also as a "reminder" of the parts of the tree which
are relevant to the query "is `elem` in S?". In fact, because the proof
gives you all the necessary sibling hashes, a proof of non-inclusion of
`elem` can be used to calculate hash(PT_insert(pt,elem)). It also allows
you to update other proofs -- if I have proofs that `x` and `y` are not in
`S`, I can calculate proofs that `x` is in `insert(S,x)` and that `y` is
not. The mechanisms of "remember" and "forget" let us generalize this
strategy.

First, let's define our "forgetful tree", `FT(height,arr)`:
    FTEmptySubtree is FT(height,arr) if:
        arr == [<EMPTY>,<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY>], and
        length(arr) == 2^height
    FTLeaf(height,elem) is FT(height,arr) if:
        arr == [<EMPTY>,...,<EMPTY>,elem,...,<EMPTY>] (ie, arr only
            contains `elem`), and
        length(arr) == 2^height
    FTBranch(l,r) is FT(height,arr) if:
        length(arr) == 2^height, and
        l is not FTEmptySubtree and
        r is not FTEmptySubtree and
        l is FT(height-1,arr[0..(length(arr)/2)]), and
        r is FT(height-1,arr[(length(arr)/2)..length(arr)]))
    FTForgottenSubtree(h) is FT(height,arr) if:
        there exists some pt: PT(height,arr) such that h == hash(pt)

Any pt: PT(height,arr) can be mapped canonically to some
ft: FT(height,arr) by mapping PTEmptySubtree, PTLeaf, and PTBranch to
FTEmptySubtree, FTLeaf, and FTBranch respectively.

Hashing FTs is the same as with PTs, except that:
    - hash(FTForgottenSubtree(h)) = h

Insertion into an FT can fail if the value would go into a
`FTForgottenSubtree`. However, if it does not, then insertion behaves
exactly identically to insertion into a PT.

We'll call `ft: FT(height,arr_S)` "well-formed" if there is some
`pt: PT(height,arr_S)` such that `hash(ft) == hash(pt)`.

Mapping a `pt: PT(height,arr_S)` to its canonical FT clearly creates a
well-formed tree.

Inserting into a well-formed FT also preserves a well-formed FT, since
insertion only succeeds when it would exactly mimic the PT operation.

The last 2 operations are `FT_remember(ft, elem, proof)` and
`FT_forget(ft, elem)`:
    FT_forget(t: FT(height,arr_S), nul: Nullifier)
            -> (FT(height,arr_S), is_present: bool, presence_proof):
        let b_0,...,b_{N-1} = H_elem(nul);
        return FT_forget_inner(t,nul,[b_{N-1},b_{N-2},...,b_0])

    FT_forget_inner(t: FT(height,arr_S), nul: Nullifier, path: [bit])

                                        FTForgottenSubtree(sib_hash));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

The last correctness property is that:
    - `forget`/`remember` preserve well-formedness
    - `remember` will always succeed given a correct proof
    - `forget` yields correct proofs
    - `forget` and `remember` do not change the hash of the tree.
    - `forget` removes the relevant path from the "in-memory" tree,
      and `remember` restores it
